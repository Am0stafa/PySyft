    "\n",
    "For a data war to happen... there must be data!\n",
    "\n",
    "And even more than that: the data must be guarded properly behind the walls of the Darth Validator to minimise any privacy or data leaks and retain ownership of the data, but also accesible to Luke CodeWalker for him to fulfill his purpose of learning relevant information from the datasets, without having direct access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, let's see how the Galactic Empire has decided this should happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real data and mock data\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works is that there will be two datasets:\n",
    "- the real dataset, containing the true unaltered information\n",
    "- a mock dataset, containing fake data generated to be of the same type to the real one\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-side domain and low-side domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The real dataset will be kept private in what is called **the high side domain**. Only the data manager have direct access to it, and not data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mock dataset will be stored into the **low side domain** and you will have direct access to it via code request.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://ibb.co/VLzYzFN\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/HKbTbc2/low-side-high-side.png\" alt=\"low-side-high-side\" border=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow altogether\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you are Luke CodeWalker and you would like to investigate the data hosted by Darth Validator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prepare the query** (purple arrows)\\\n",
    "Luke knows what he would like to learn from Darth Validator's data, so he can prepare a code request, but will only be able to run it against the mock dataset on the low-side domain. The dataset will look and feel like the real one, but it won't contain the true data, thus useful for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submit the code request** (orange arrows)\\\n",
    "Luke can submit the code query for approval from Darth Validator. The code is sent via PySyft API directly to the him, the data manager, who will check the code, make sure it is safe to be run on the private, highly secured data, and if so, Darth Validator will execute the code on the private data, and generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Get the answer** (orange arrows)\\\n",
    "After Darth Validator runs the code, he will also inspect the answer to make sure privacy is preserved before sharing it with his biggest enemy, Luke CodeWalker. If it is fine, Darth will send the unaltered answer which the function returned on the private, real data this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup will therefore consist of:\n",
    "- prepare the low-side server\n",
    "- generate and upload the data to the servers (real & mock)\n",
    "- give access to the data scientist to the low-side\n",
    "- check that we are ready\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is run through the following code cells without any change and checking that it worked, as the whole Galactic Empire (and the following steps) depend on it."
