    "## What are masked arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following problem. You have a dataset with missing or invalid entries. If you're doing any kind of processing on this data, and want to *skip* or flag these unwanted entries without just deleting them, you may have to use conditionals or filter your data somehow. The [numpy.ma](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/maskedarray.generic.html#module-numpy.ma) module provides some of the same functionality of [NumPy ndarrays](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray) with added structure to ensure invalid entries are not used in computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Reference Guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/maskedarray.generic.html#module-numpy.ma):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A masked array is the combination of a standard [numpy.ndarray](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray) and a **mask**. A mask is either `nomask`, indicating that no value of the associated array is invalid, or an array of booleans that determines for each element of the associated array whether the value is valid or not. When an element of the mask is `False`, the corresponding element of the associated array is valid and is said to be unmasked. When an element of the mask is `True`, the corresponding element of the associated array is said to be masked (invalid).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a [MaskedArray](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/maskedarray.baseclass.html#numpy.ma.MaskedArray) as a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data, as a regular `numpy.ndarray` of any shape or datatype;\n",
    "- A boolean mask with the same shape as the data;\n",
    "- A `fill_value`, a value that may be used to replace the invalid entries in order to return a standard `numpy.ndarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When can they be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few situations where masked arrays can be more useful than just eliminating the invalid entries of an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you want to preserve the values you masked for later processing, without copying the array;\n",
    "- When you have to handle many arrays, each with their own mask. If the mask is part of the array, you avoid bugs and the code is possibly more compact;\n",
    "- When you have different flags for missing or invalid values, and wish to preserve these flags without replacing them in the original dataset, but exclude them from computations;\n",
    "- If you can't avoid or eliminate missing values, but don't want to deal with [NaN (Not a Number)](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/constants.html#numpy.nan) values in your operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masked arrays are also a good idea since the `numpy.ma` module also comes with a specific implementation of most [NumPy universal functions (ufuncs)](https://numpy.org/devdocs/glossary.html#term-ufunc), which means that you can still apply fast vectorized functions and operations on masked data. The output is then a masked array. We'll see some examples of how this works in practice below."

However, only the first few rows contain data for the the first column (province names in China). Following that, we only have country names. So it would make sense to group all the data from China into a single row. For this, we'll select from the `nbcases` array only the rows for which the second entry of the `locations` array corresponds to China. Next, we'll use the [numpy.sum](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html#numpy.sum) function to sum all the selected rows (`axis=0`).
