    "Fractals are beautiful, compelling mathematical forms that can be oftentimes created from a relatively simple set of instructions. In nature they can be found in various places, such as coastlines, seashells, and ferns, and even were used in creating certain types of antennas. The mathematical idea of fractals was known for quite some time, but they really began to be truly appreciated in the 1970's as advancements in computer graphics and some accidental discoveries lead researchers like [Benoît Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) to stumble upon the truly mystifying visualizations that fractals possess.\n",

For this, we can use **[Boolean Indexing](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.indexing.html#boolean-array-indexing)**, a NumPy feature that when paired with universal functions is unbeatable.
